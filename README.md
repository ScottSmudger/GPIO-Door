# GPIO-Door
A simple python-based program that monitors a Raspberry-PI GPIO pin connected to a magnetic door switch. A MySQL database is updated with the new state.

A web-interface built in PHP will display any data in the MySQL database and display the usage statistics of the door.

This project is for the Group Project Design and Implementation modules of my Computer Networking and Security BSc at [Glyndwr University](https://www.glyndwr.ac.uk/).
