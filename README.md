# Smart-Appliances
A simple python-based program that monitors a Raspberry-Pi's General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins connected to a magnetic door switch (as of now). A MySQL database is updated with the new appliances state.

A [web-interface](http://uni.scottsmudger.website) built using PHP/HTML/CSS with some elements of JavaScript and jQuery, is used to display the usage statistics of the appliances and any relevant user information.

This project is for the Group Project Design & Implementation modules of my Computer Networking and Security BSc Degree at [Glyndwr University](https://www.glyndwr.ac.uk/). It may also be used for my disseration in the third year.
